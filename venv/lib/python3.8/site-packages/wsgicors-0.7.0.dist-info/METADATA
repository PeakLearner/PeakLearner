This is a WSGI middleware that answers CORS preflight requests and adds
the needed header to the response. For CORS see:
http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/

Usage
-----

Either plug it in programmatically as in this pyramid example:

.. code:: python


    def app(global_config, **settings):
        """ This function returns a WSGI application.

        It is usually called by the PasteDeploy framework during 
        ``paster serve``.
        """

        def get_root(request):
            return {}

        config = Configurator(root_factory=get_root, settings=settings)
        config.begin()
        # whatever it takes to config your app goes here
        config.end()

        from wsgicors import CORS
        return CORS(config.make_wsgi_app(), headers="*", methods="*", maxage="180", origin="*")

or plug it into your wsgi pipeline via paste ini to let it serve by
waitress for instance:

::

    [app:myapp]
    use = egg:mysuperapp#app

    ###
    # wsgi server configuration
    ###

    [server:main]
    use = egg:waitress#main
    host = 0.0.0.0
    port = 6543

    [pipeline:main]
    pipeline =
        cors
        myapp

    [filter:cors]
    use = egg:wsgicors#middleware
    # define a "free" policy
    free_origin=copy
    free_headers=*
    free_expose_headers=*
    free_methods=HEAD, OPTIONS, GET
    free_maxage=180

    # define a "subdom" policy
    subdom_origin=http://example.com http://example2.com https://*.example.com
    subdom_headers=*
    subdom_methods=HEAD, OPTIONS, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
    subdom_expose_headers=Foo, Doom
    subdom_maxage=180

    # define a combination of policies, they are evaluated in the order given by the policy keyword
    # the first that matches the request's origin will be used
   policy=subdom,free
    # policy matching strategy
    # matchstrategy=firstmatch

Keywords are:

-  ``origin``
-  ``headers``
-  ``methods``
-  ``credentials``
-  ``maxage``

for ``origin``:

-  use ``copy`` which will copy whatever origin the request comes from
-  a space separated list of hostnames - they can also contain wildcards
   like ``*`` or ``?`` (fnmatch lib is used for matching). If a match is
   found the original host is returned.
-  any other literal will be be copied verbatim (like ``*`` for instance
   to allow any source)

for ``headers``:

-  use ``*`` which will allow whatever header is asked for
-  any other literal will be be copied verbatim

for ``expose_headers``:

-  use ``*`` to allow access to any header the client might wish to access
-  any other literal will be be copied verbatim

for ``methods``:

-  use ``*`` which will allow whatever method is asked for
-  any other literal will be be copied verbatim (like
   ``POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE`` for instance)

for ``credentials``:

-  use ``true``
-  anything else will be ignored (that is no response header for
   ``Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`` is sent)

for ``maxage``:

-  give the number of seconds the answer can be used by a client,
   anything nonempty will be copied verbatim

As can be seen in the example above, a policy needs to be created with
the ``policy`` keyword. The options need then be prefixed with the
policy name and a ``_``.
The ``policy`` keyword itself can be a comma separated list. If so the origin of the request is matched against the origins defined in the policies and the first matching is the policy used.
An alternative matching strategy would be ``verbmatch``, that selects the first of the listed that also matches the request method. To switch between the strategies use the

``matchstrategy`` keyword:

- use ``firstmatch`` (the default) to select the first of the policies that matches on the ``origin`` keyword
- use ``verbmatch`` to select the first of the policies that matches on the ``methods`` and ``origin`` keyword


Changes
=======

Version 0.7.0
-------------
- ``verbmulti`` matching strategy, that matches the first listed policy that also matches the requested METHOD
- relaxed dependency on lru_cache version

Version 0.6.0
-------------
- support for multiple policies
- caching of matching results

Version 0.5.1
-------------
- check for request being preflight
- reworked tests

Version 0.5.0
-------------

- support for Access-Control-Expose-Headers
- Header ``Vary`` is set to ``Origin`` if origin policy differs from ``*``

Version 0.4.1
-------------

-  py3 utf-8 related setup fixes

Version 0.4
-----------

-  python3 compatibility

Version 0.3
-----------

-  ``origin`` now takes space separated list of hostnames. They can be
   filename patterns like \*.domain.tld

Version 0.2
-----------

-  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is now returned in the actual
   reponse if specified by policy
